# S3 Backend Module
This module was copied from terraform-in-action/s3backend/aws.
It was then modified and published, mainly for learning purposes.
It works but likely is NOT something you want for production.

File terraform.tfvars could look like:

region    = "us-east-1"
namespace = "my-test-1"
